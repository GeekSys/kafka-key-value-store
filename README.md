# Queryable Kafka Topics with Kafka Streams

This repository provides the source code for our blog post on [Medium](https://medium.com/bakdata/queryable-kafka-topics-with-kafka-streams-8d2cca9de33f).

It includes an example implementation of a Kafka Streams application that provides a key-value query interface to the messages of a key-partitioned Kafka topic.

Additionally, a Dockerfile and a Kubernetes deployment specification demonstrate how the application can be easily deployed to a Kubernetes Cluster.
